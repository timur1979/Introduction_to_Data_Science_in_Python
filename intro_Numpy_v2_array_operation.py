# We can do many things on arrays, such as mathematical manipulation (addition, subtraction, square,
# exponents) as well as use boolean arrays, which are binary values. We can also do matrix manipulation such
# as product, transpose, inverse, and so forth.

# Arithmetic operators on array apply elementwise.

# Let's create a couple of arrays
a = np.array([10,20,30,40])
b = np.array([1, 2, 3,4])

# Now let's look at a minus b
c = a-b
print(c)

print("=============1")
# And let's look at a times b
d = a*b
print(d)

print("=============2")
# With arithmetic manipulation, we can convert current data to the way we want it to be. Here's a real-world
# problem I face - I moved down to the United States about 6 years ago from Canada. In Canada we use celcius
# for temperatures, and my wife still hasn't converted to the US system which uses farenheit. With numpy I 
# could easily convert a number of farenheit values, say the weather forecase, to ceclius

# Let's create an array of typical Ann Arbor winter farenheit values
farenheit = np.array([0,-10,-5,-15,0])

# And the formula for conversion is ((°F − 32) × 5/9 = °C)
celcius = (farenheit - 31) * (5/9)
print(celcius)


print("=============3")
# Great, so now she knows it's a little chilly outside but not so bad.

# Another useful and important manipulation is the boolean array. We can apply an operator on an array, and a
# boolean array will be returned for any element in the original, with True being emitted if it meets the condition and False oetherwise.
# For instance, if we want to get a boolean array to check celcius degrees that are greater than -20 degrees
print(celcius > -20)

print("=============4")
# Here's another example, we could use the modulus operator to check numbers in an array to see if they are even. Recall that modulus does division but throws away everything but the remainder (decimal) portion)
print(celcius%2 == 0)



print("=============5")
# Besides elementwise manipulation, it is important to know that numpy supports matrix manipulation. Let's
# look at matrix product. if we want to do elementwise product, we use the "*" sign
A = np.array([[1,1],[0,1]])
B = np.array([[2,0],[3,4]])
print(A*B)

print("=============5.1")
# if we want to do matrix product, we use the "@" sign or use the dot function
print(A@B)


print("=============6")
# You don't have to worry about complex matrix operations for this course, but it's important to know that
# numpy is the underpinning of scientific computing libraries in python, and that it is capable of doing both
# element-wise operations (the asterix) as well as matrix-level operations (the @ sign). There's more on this
# in a subsequent course.

# A few more linear algebra concepts are worth layering in here. You might recall that the product of two
# matrices is only plausible when the inner dimensions of the two matrices are the same. The dimensions refer
# to the number of elements both horizontally and vertically in the rendered matricies you've seen here. We
# can use numpy to quickly see the shape of a matrix:
print(A.shape)



print("=============7")
# When manipulating arrays of different types, the type of the resulting array will correspond to 
# the more general of the two types. This is called upcasting.

# Let's create an array of integers
array1 = np.array([[1, 2, 3], [4, 5, 6]])
print(array1.dtype)

# Now let's create an array of floats
array2 = np.array([[7.1, 8.2, 9.1], [10.4, 11.2, 12.3]])
print(array2.dtype)



# Integers (int) are whole numbers only, and Floating point numbers (float) can have a whole number portion
# and a decimal portion. The 64 in this example refers to the number of bits that the operating system is
# reserving to represent the number, which determines the size (or precision) of the numbers that can be
# represented.


# Let's do an addition for the two arrays
array3=array1+array2
print(array3)
print(array3.dtype)

# Notice how the items in the resulting array have been upcast into floating point numbers


print("=============8")

# Numpy arrays have many interesting aggregation functions on them, such as  sum(), max(), min(), and mean()
print(array3.sum())
print(array3.max())
print(array3.min())
print(array3.mean())


print("=============9")
# For two dimensional arrays, we can do the same thing for each row or column
# let's create an array with 15 elements, ranging from 1 to 15, 
# with a dimension of 3X5
b = np.arange(1,16,1).reshape(3,5)
print(b)
